This is website made for the ways to help Afgahnistan and help the women of Afghanistan. This is all started with my grandmother fighing for educuation rights under the rule of the taliban. I wanted to make a wesbite that can show ways to help the people of Afghanistan without donating and how you can fight for us and help us regain freedom in our country.
